### Getting-Started

**What is Github?**
Ans: 

Hello guys this is basically the starting of the **"How to make your profile good?"**

**First step: Geting your Student Developer Pack** (Optional)
1. If your'e a student go get Github's Student Developer Pack.
2. This gives you #pro features for many tools.
3. **Link:** https://education.github.com/pack

**Second Step: Readme.md file**
1. Have a nice Readme file for your Github Profile
2. It will just be appealing for anyone when they just open your profile.
3. Just look at the Readme file I crearted for my profile https://github.com/KarthikMothiki

**Third Step: Upload your Repositories**
1. This is a simple process.
2. Open your profile, navigate to repositories tab.
3. There you'll find a green button, named **New** click on that and give a name for your repository.
4. It can be private or public. 
5. We can upload the code directly from our VCS (Version Control System) or we can do that manually

For the overview, create a new repository with your username itself. This is a special Repository. Its README.md will appear on your public profile! 

We will be discussing the further steps later.
